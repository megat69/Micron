# Micron
Micron is a small open source web browser made in Python.

Currently, it only supports local plain HTML files, and with very few functionalities.

<details>
<summary>## Install</summary>
To install Micron, go in the [releases tab and select the latest one](https://github.com/megat69/Micron/releases/latest).

You will find a ZIP file, which contains a python file (`main.py`), and an HTML file (`index.html`).

Modify the HTML file as you wish.

<summary>## Running my HTML file</summary>
- If you modified `index.html`, then you should just type `python main.py` in the any console of your computer.
- If you created another file, then type `python main.py -f <path>`.
- For more help, type `python main.py -h`
